## Conventions

1. Write clean LaTeX code:
    * write *readable* LaTeX, as you would write readable Python, Julia, Matlab, etc.
    * indent two spaces, no tabs,
    * set your text editor to wrap long lines
    * one line = one sentence
2. Use `hyperref`, `nameref` and `cleveref` whenever possible

Enjoy!
